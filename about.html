<p> Bharath Group of Companiesas initially founded to provide solvent recovery systems to various industries with diverse applications. Our client list includes 
many large Fortune 500 companies, as well as small family-owned operations.  The company found a need in the industry for process equipment such as washing systems, compactors,
 and aerosol recovery systems which we started engineering and manufacturing for printing and other industries. Today we have expanded our product line to incorporate the 
Biodiesel industry including: methanol recovery systems, solvent extractors, high FFA feedstock pretreatment units, and full Biodiesel plants.  Our engineers are backed 
with vast experience and because of that we were approached to engineer several custom projects including a very unique project for an oil refinery in UAE.
